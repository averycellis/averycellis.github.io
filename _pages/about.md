Hello! My name is Avery Ellis and I am an incoming PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm broadly interested in political behavior and political methodology, particularly in the context of American politics. Specifically, I'm interested in studying political persuasion through Bayesian methods. My (in-development) research agenda analyzes persuasion as a two-step process, focusing on two stages: first, distinguishing partisan motivated reasoning from rational Bayesian updating in the formation of political opinion; second, utilizing Bayesian methods to examine how political information, once accepted, restructures beliefs.

I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I received my B.A. in Mathematics and Government & Legal Studies from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where my senior thesis examining John Zaller's RAS model was awarded Highest Honors from the Government & Legal Studies department. After completing my undergraduate degree, I spent a year and a half in industry, working at Fidelity Investments in a variety of roles, from quant research to internal consulting to data analytics. 

Outside of my research interests, I love to ride bikes, ski (both downhill and cross-country), run, and spend time outside. I rowed for Bowdoin as an undergraduate and spent seven summers as a wilderness trip leader, and I'm always eager to explore the world, particularly through endurance sport. Recent highlights include riding from Boston to Portland, ME in October 2025, a marathon in June 2025, and bikepacking the Kokopelli Trail from Fruita, CO to Moab, UT in April 2025.

Currently, I'm spending a few months traveling the world before I move to Berkeley. Some planned adventures: three days on Easter Island, three weeks in Japan this spring (including hiking the island of Yakushima and cycling around Mt. Fuji), and following the Tour de France this summer.
